## Getting Started

1. Clone or download this repository.  
2. Place all files in the same directory (including audio files).  
3. Open `index.html` in any modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).  
4. Select a board size and start a game using the buttons.  

## Customization

- **Sounds**: You can replace `click.wav` and `capture.wav` with your own sound files.  
- **Styling**: The dark mode and layout can be adjusted in the `<style>` section of `index.html`.  
- **AI Depth**: The difficulty of the AI can be changed by modifying the Minimax depth in `Board.ts`.  

## Known Limitations

- This is a simplified implementation and does not handle full Japanese or Chinese scoring rules.  
- The AI is basic and may not always play strong moves.  
- No support for pass or game-end negotiation (yet).
